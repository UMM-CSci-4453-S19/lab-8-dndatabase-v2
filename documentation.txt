API:
*Not quite sure what needs to be documented here, but here we go*
We have functions for communicating between the database and client. They range from accessing a mySQL database to queries about getting rows from tables/updating another table with rows to doing specific things during specific actions like clicking a button for adding or removing a speicfic item from the transaction list. .
