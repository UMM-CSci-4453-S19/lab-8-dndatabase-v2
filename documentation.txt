API:
*Not quite sure what needs to be documented here, but here we go*
We have functions for communicating between the database and client. They range from accessing a mySQL database to queries about getting rows from tables/updating another table with rows to doing specific things during specific actions like clicking a button for adding or removing a speicfic item from the transaction list. .  


/buttons returns json to the client

/transaction takens current item in transaction as json and send that json to the client

/click?id= takens in an id through req.params and finds all values in the id column of inventory table that match the id given.

/list sends the current items  in the transaction transaction, an array containing item name, price and amount,  back to the client.

/remove?id= takens an id using req.params and deletes from the transaction table where the id passed to /remove matches the id in the
  transaction table.
